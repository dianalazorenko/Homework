            <p>The term “nature” includes all around us: trees, lakes, mountains, seas, animals, flowers, etc. So, nature is something special not controlled by humans. How marvelous and rich nature is!

                Human beings have been closely attaching to nature since time out of memory. In period of paganism people were frightened of such natural sources as storm, thunder, earthquake and downpour. That’s why they made some sacrifices to the mother-nature because ancient people believed it could gain nature’s favour and make their life easier and better.

        <p>Sometimes we forget about beauty and richness of nature around us because we are just used to thinking about ourselves and vested interests. You can notice many miracles if you pay attention to them: twitter of birds, sounds of rain and wind, great mountains, green hills and bright sunlight.</p>
