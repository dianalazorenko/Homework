            <p>In our century the attitude to it has been changed. People learned to read the sky, avoid dangerous results of “nature’s rage” and explain all the phenomena scientifically. Now people know how to deal with nature for personal use – they created hydro-electric power stations, solar batteries, lighting conductors, successful agriculture systems and other interesting things. We use natural resources permanently and it helps us survive, but they are not endless and we should not forget to take care about it.</p>
